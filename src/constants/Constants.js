    "The Zero Theorem is a new economic framework to establish the forward valuation of Bitcoin and proof of work (PoW) digital assets. The underlying hypothesis is that in the short term any purchasing power (PP) is finite as the monetary substance cannot be created instantaneously. Hence the change of such PP of individual instruments (currencies, equities, commodities, tangible, etc) in an asset universe must in aggregate equate to zero, maintaining a zero-sum game-theoretical equilibrium. If the aggregate change of all asset PP must equate to zero (in the short term) then changes in the value of PoW digital assets like Bitcoin can only be occurring via a substitution phenomenon (α). α represents the rate at which value is being absorbed from alternative or inferior instruments. This intrinsically implies that α is driven by portfolio optimisations of multiple economic agents, where investor utility is being maximised via a range of financial and not financial attributes. The Zero Theorem allows one to analytically solve the fair value pricing dilemma of PoW digital assets by 1. transposing the equation of exchange, 2. introducing mining work as means of economic output, and 3. forecasting future α to determine the forward market size relative to the global asset universe.",

  ABOUT:
    "The Zero Theorem is a new economic framework to establish forward valuation of Bitcoin and proof of work (PoW) digital assets. The underlying hypothesis is that in the short term any purchasing power (PP) is finite as monetary substance cannot be created instantaneously. Hence the change of such PP of individual instruments (currencies, equities, commodities, tangible, etc) in an asset universe must in aggregate equate to zero, maintaining a zero-sum game theoretical equilibrium. The Zero Theorem allows one to analytically solve the fair value pricing dilemma of PoW digital assets by 1. transposing the equation of exchange, 2. introducing mining work as means of economic output and 3. forecasting future Î± to determine the forward market size relative to the global asset universe.",
